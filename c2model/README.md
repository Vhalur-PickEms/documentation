# C2 Model
As a preparation for this project, I have made two models from the C4 software architecture model. These will help me write down my thoughts and ideas on this project.
This document can then be used to talk to potential stakeholders both with and without coding experience.

### Context Diagram
The first model I created was a context diagram, and as the name suggests, it's here to give an overall system context. 
This model is intended for anyone involved with the project, both in and outside of the team. The benefit of the context diagram is the  simplicity of it. 
You do not need to be a studied software engineer to understand this model.

### Container Diagram
A container diagram represents the individual services used in the project. These services can be run separately, as is the intention of a multi-distributed architecture. 
This container diagram is intended for developers part of the team. Non-developers will have a harder time understanding this diagram.

# Sprint 1 // 27/04/23 - 10/05/23
### Feedup
- Work 1 hour per day
- Research user stories
- Create a user story to work on
- Set up Jira with tasks based on the user story
- Implement the code needed for user story

### Feedback
Working one hour a day went well. Kept a worklog to track my own activity. The current back-end is lacking. I need more functionality to meet the semester requirements. I need to include an ORM. It's a shame I'm using C# again and am not learning a new language, could have done that if I started on time. 

Overall a good first sprint.  

### Feedforward
Keep up the 1 hour a day at least. If I'm working well and have a nice flow going, extending time is fine. 
Start my first research and create a minimal API. 


# Sprint 2 // 11/05/23 - 02/06/23 
### Feedup
- Catch up portfolio
- Create a Minimal API with at least a post function
- Use an ORM
- Implement the API fetch & post in the front-end
- Learn about DOT research
- Start first research

### Feedback
A lot of good progress was made during sprint 2. All of the set goals have been accomplished. Due to sickness the sprint length was increased by a week and a half. During the extra week and a half I have spend my time starting with CI/CD. I was able to set-up the first step of CI/CD having a small test before merging branches. I've also been able to manually create an image of my MinimalAPI that runs in a container. 
I did notice I became a bit more lax when it came to the 1 hour per day. 

### Feedforward
'2 steps forward, 1 step back' is what I keep in my head when working. As mentioned I became a bit more lax, so I'm going to step up and icnrease how strict I will be on this. 1 Hour EACH day minimum, even on the long days. 
As for the project, my main goals will be increasing the CI/CD production with techniques such as static code analysis and automatically creating a docker container when merging branches. 

# Sprint 3 // 02/05/23 - 09/06/23 
### Feedup
- Keep portfolio up to date
- Work consistency 
- Static Code Analysis (Sonarcloud)
- CI/CD improvement
- Contract Testing

### Feedback
The goals that had been set for sprint 3 have all been accomplished. All of the features I wanted to implement such as Sonarcloud and contract testing have been added and work. Ofcourse in a minimal fashion, but they are there. I have changed the CI/CD workflow of my project to my desire. Currently every pull request that is made will be tested and run through Sonarcloud. Only merge requests towards main will create and push a docker image IF the previous tests succeed. I have been more consistent and even went over the 1 hour per day multiple times. I'm really starting to enjoy this. 

### Feedforward
For the next sprint I want to focus on rounding out the semester. To accomplish this, the main priority will be adding security to the front-end and back-end.  I'll be using Auth0 as an OAuth provider. After this the focus will be a bit on documentation and the portfolio. Make sure these are ready to be delivered by the end of the weekend.

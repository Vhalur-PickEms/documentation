### Feedback
Working one hour a day went well. Kept a worklog to track my own activity. The current back-end is lacking. I need more functionality to meet the semester requirements. I need to include an ORM. It's a shame I'm using C# again and am not learning a new language, could have done that if I started on time. 

Overall a good first sprint.  

### Feedforward
Keep up the 1 hour a day at least. If I'm working well and have a nice flow going, extending time is fine. 
Start my first research and create a minimal API.

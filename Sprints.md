### Feedback
Working one hour a day went well. Kept a worklog to track my own activity. The current back-end is lacking. I need more functionality to meet the semester requirements. I need to include an ORM. It's a shame I'm using C# again and am not learning a new language, could have done that if I started on time. 

Overall a good first sprint.  

### Feedforward
Keep up the 1 hour a day at least. If I'm working well and have a nice flow going, extending time is fine. 
Start my first research and create a minimal API.

### Feedup

- Create a Minimal API with at least a post function
- Use an ORM
- Implement the API fetch & post in the front-end

- Start first research

### Feedback
A lot of good progress was made during sprint 2. All of the set goals have been accomplished. Due to sickness the sprint length was increased by a week and a half. During the extra week and a half I have spend my time starting with CI/CD. I was able to set-up the first step of CI/CD having a small test before merging branches. I've also been able to manually create an image of my MinimalAPI that runs in a container. 
I did notice I became a bit more lax when it came to the 1 hour per day. 

### Feedforward
'2 steps forward, 1 step back' is what I keep in my head when working. As mentioned I became a bit more lax, so I'm going to step up and icnrease how strict I will be on this. 1 Hour EACH day minimum, even on the long days. 
As for the project, my main goals will be increasing the CI/CD production with techniques such as static code analysis and automatically creating a docker container when merging branches.

# Personal Reflection

I started the semester with a rough start. I had not properly started working until halfway through. When I finally (and thankfully) found the motivation to start, 
my teacher told me to start working 1 hour every day. The intention behind this was to help me train my motivation and not get overwhelmed. 
To assist myself with this I decided to log all the hours I made. With this, I could … declare the hours I spend on the project to myself. 
I realized what I was actually doing was gathering data on myself when I did schoolwork.  Now, a few weeks later, I took the time to reflect on my work patterns. 
I learned a few interesting things from this.

1.	On days where I got home ‘late’ (from work or school) I rarely had the motivation to work on school. However, days like Monday where I had worked from home all day on the group project, 
I did have the motivation to continue working for another hour on my individual project.

2.  My motivation goes down with the duration of the day. I always used to think I was a night person, but the most effective work I have done have all been done in the early hours. 
If I had to leave for work at 9:20, I would wake up at 7 and do schoolwork from 8 to 9. I felt motivated to do so and I remember always feeling good about myself when cycling towards work.

3.  My motivation drops a lot when I am unsure what I should be doing next. When I do not have a clear path of what to do, I lose focus and start procrastinating. This is not specific to any situation.
Even as I am writing this and I’m not completely sure how to express myself I can feel my attention slipping. A good thing is that I have become aware of this ‘issue’, 
and I am becoming better at recognizing I am losing focus and can more often bring my attention back.

4.  Continuing the last point, having a good preparation helps me A LOT. While I have not used it as much as I should have, I think a program like JIRA helps me a lot. 
At the start of a sprint there are a few tasks you want to do. Let’s say I planned to start my first research this sprint. A task like that is big and I might not be sure what it completely entails. 
Because of that, I get overwhelmed, and I don’t know how to start leading to bad motivation and I start procrastinating. To combat this, slicing a task up in mini tasks can help me. 
These tasks do not need to be extremely detailed; they need to be smaller and more achievable. 

5.  I enjoy the act of coding and solving issues. While this one should be obvious as I am following a software engineering course, I have come to realize I enjoy the act of coding. 
I remember I worked about 6 hours on integrating Auth0 in my project. When I started on this task of implementing security, I had no idea where to start and that scared me a bit. 
Thankfully, my motivation was already quite high due to my work attitude over the past week, and it allowed me to overcome this insecurity on not knowing how to implement it. 
I started early Friday afternoon and finished at midnight. It did not work properly yet, but I made a lot of progress, and I enjoyed those hours of coding and problem solving, 
even if it did not end up working as intended.

When I started this ‘journey’ of finishing semester 3, I remember my teacher gave me a piece of advice: “You’re a student, remember what the responsibilities are of a student”. This has been on the back of my mind quite a bit, especially when I was lower on motivation. Now, at the end, I genuinely feel I have grown a lot as a student. I learned a lot about myself and what does and does not work for me.
